Keyboard.js

Adding some old javascript code which I found relating to virtual keyboards.

First is a keyboard in implemented in Canvas.

Then is an attempt to build a swype alternative with dictionary.

There was a bookmarklet.
 
There was also a thought to also add chinese support for it. 
 
And there was a 3d version.

I found this out of my attic archival, and it needs some maintainance and modernization for it to be working nicely again.
