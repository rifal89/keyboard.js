Keyboard.js

Some virtualized on screen keyboard experiments.

Current experiments
- Canvas Keyboard that integrates with HTML input elements
- Swype alternative with dictionary
- CSS3D version

Warning, some of these code is really old (from 2010).

I found them and thought that it would be good to keep the virtual keyboards on github.
It is also one of my early experiments with canvas and bookmarklets.
So yeah, it needs some maintainance and modernization for it to be working nicely again.

But here's some ideas on what can be done.
1. Add chinese/pinyin support for glide/swipe input
2. Add touchstart input for keyboard
3. Experiment with different layouts (like Microsoft Word Flow keyboard)
4. VR / A-Frame keyboard
